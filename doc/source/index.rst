   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to zombie's documentation!
========================================

Zombie is a Python driver for Zombie.js (http://zombie.labnotes.org/), a headless browser
powered by node.js (http://nodejs.org).
This fork (python-zombie-mgh) was primarily created to get it to work
under MS Windows.::

    from zombie import Browser
    browser = Browser()

    # Fill email and password, then submit form
    browser.visit("http://localhost:8080/").fill(
        "email",
        "zombie@underworld.dead"
    ).fill(
        "password",
        "eat-the-living"
    ).pressButton(
        "Sign Me Up!"
    )

    assert browser.success
    assert browser.text("title") == "Welcome to Brains Depot"

NB: You need to have zombie.js installed properly, so that it can
be required by the JS server code (e. g., set $NODE_PATH correctly).

As much as possible, the methods of :class:`zombie.browser.Browser` are
analogous to the methods of Zombie.js' ``Browser`` class
(http://zombie.labnotes.org/API).
